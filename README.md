# EVRP-Concepcio
Final project for the course "Taller en optimizaci贸n" in Universidad de Concepci贸n. Consists of the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem applied to the city of Concepci贸n, Chile using ant colony optimization metaheuristic and osmnx library to proccess the coordinates of the places in the city as nodes for the problem.

The EVRP-ACO.py file requires a .evrp extension file with instance iformation, for the moment there is only one instance with the coordinates of some places in Concepci贸n, the file structure is based on M. Mavrovouniotis benchmark sets, available on https://github.com/Mavrovouniotis/e-cvrp_benchmark_instances, modified to contain the geocoordinates instead of normal coordinates.
